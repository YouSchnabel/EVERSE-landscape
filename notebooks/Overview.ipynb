Interoperability is achieved by supporting common data formats, protocols, and APIs, enabling seamless integration with other tools and systems. Prioritising efficiency means optimising code to minimize resource usage and ensuring the software can handle large datasets or complex computations without performance degradation. Long-term maintenance requires planning for regular updates, securing funding, and providing detailed developer documentation to ease future enhancements and bug fixes. Finally, implementing mechanisms for feedback and bug reporting, such as issue trackers in GitHub, allows users to contribute to the software's continuous improvement, ensuring it remains responsive to their evolving needs. |\n",
