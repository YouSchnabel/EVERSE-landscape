This is an easy way where the developer can explore the data, manipulate it in many ways and clean it if necessary. Data visualisation is also often involved, with the use of many already available packages such as matplotlib, plotly, and many others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

This package can then published in BioConda (https://bioconda.github.io/) where then other researches can access it and use it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Interoperability is achieved by supporting common data formats, protocols, and APIs, enabling seamless integration with other tools and systems. Prioritising efficiency means optimising code to minimize resource usage and ensuring the software can handle large datasets or complex computations without performance degradation. Long-term maintenance requires planning for regular updates, securing funding, and providing detailed developer documentation to ease future enhancements and bug fixes. Finally, implementing mechanisms for feedback and bug reporting, such as issue trackers in GitHub, allows users to contribute to the software's continuous improvement, ensuring it remains responsive to their evolving needs. |

Key elements include writing automated tests (unit, integration, and regression tests) to ensure code correctness, using version control systems, and following code review processes to improve code quality. These practices help ensure that research software is reliable, maintainable, and reproducible.                                                           |                                                                                                                           | Planning; Development; Maintenance            | General guidelines                                          |

| 20 | As general guideline for software development and deployment is to keep the software packages and dependencies updated as much as possible, as working with outdated software can pose risks on the security of the software, especially if developing a front-end or back-end web infrastructure. Moreover, in general updating the dependencies and the overall environment can improve the execution time, and increase the efficiency of the software. |                                                                                                                           | Development; Maintenance                      | General guidelines                                          |

| 22 | The core development team provides support to anyone willing to contribute to the project in terms of resolving issues that the individual contributor may not be privy to given the size of the whole project. There are regular developer workshops held by the core dev team which contain demos and usage guidelines for new contributors. The core team also lists a number of examples on usage and development of the project that are easy to replicate and follow. | Institute or Organization                                                             | The project does not provide compute resources to contributors. Having state of the art compute resources (eg. dedicated nodes at a HPC) can help accelerate the decelopment process by having a standardized test suite for new algorithms without requiring developers to create local builds of the project which almost always causes user-hardware related dependency issues. |

So far, there is no clear route of hand over, especially if the initial developer (group) is not reachable (e.g. left the field). Clear guidelines are missing here. |

|  0 | Definitely missing financing for quality because all it takes to get research published is a working PoC/prototype. Long-term maintenance is not publicly funded.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|  2 | The maintenance of research software components and infrastructures which were born in many research projects depend on finding a way to sustain the needed financing to pay both the researchers and developers, and the costs of the hardware infrastructure, usually in the form of continuation research projects which are not always 100% aligned with that purpose |
|  3 | There is a lack of continued financial support as a result not always to have access to the needed infrastructure to run software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| 10 | Research software and its substantial part in the process of gaining knowledge has only be recently accepted by the funding agencies. So there are some funding possibilities, but usually only focussed on development (and maybe archiving), not so on the maintenance of software. Mostly the funding is available on a national level.                                |
| 11 | Almost no funding for permanent RSE positions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12 | In my country there are no initiatives to support ensuring software quality that I know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 22 | Software quality and maintenance is not the main focus of the project currently and all maintenance is done by the core development team without dedicated finances for the same as far as I am aware.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 27 | There is some support for scientists, e.g. by the Helmholtz platform HIFIS. But that does not scale down to all development groups. I do not know explicit funding for SW quality in research, except smaller projects.                                                                                                                                                   |

|  6 | Many codes are executed on large distributed computing infrastructures therefore the correct functioning both in terms of malware (fraudulent usage of resources) and accuracy (waste of resources) is most important.                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10 | Accuracy should be part of all publication quality control, so all best scientific practices                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|  0 | I'm interested in software discovery and once held a presentation about software quality indicators visible on discovery platforms.                                                                                                               |
