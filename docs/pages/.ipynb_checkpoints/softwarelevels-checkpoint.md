| 20 | Guidelines for the development and publication of a pipeline as Python package for high throughput data analysis . | In general, software analysis, involves the use of Jupyter notebooks (https://jupyter.org/) for quick start of data analysis with Python. This is an easy way where the developer can explore the data, manipulate it in many ways and clean it if necessary. Data visualisation is also often involved, with the use of many already available packages such as matplotlib, plotly, and many others.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| 23 | reproducibility, documentation, and proper citation of tools, coding standards like PEP8, FAIR principles          | I follow a combination of general software development guidelines, such as coding standards (like PEP 8 for Python), version control practices with Git, and thorough testing and documentation. For research-specific needs, I prioritize reproducibility by using tools like Jupyter Notebooks, managing data carefully, and employing containerization. I also adhere to community-specific guidelines, such as best practices in data science for model tracking and bioinformatics standards for reproducibility. Additionally, I incorporate principles from the Research Software Engineering community and the FAIR guidelines to ensure that my research code is sustainable, collaborative, and accessible. |

Interoperability is achieved by supporting common data formats, protocols, and APIs, enabling seamless integration with other tools and systems. Prioritising efficiency means optimising code to minimize resource usage and ensuring the software can handle large datasets or complex computations without performance degradation. Long-term maintenance requires planning for regular updates, securing funding, and providing detailed developer documentation to ease future enhancements and bug fixes. Finally, implementing mechanisms for feedback and bug reporting, such as issue trackers in GitHub, allows users to contribute to the software's continuous improvement, ensuring it remains responsive to their evolving needs. |

Key elements include writing automated tests (unit, integration, and regression tests) to ensure code correctness, using version control systems, and following code review processes to improve code quality.

| 16 | Planning: : Emphasizes iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. Guidelines suggest how to break down projects into sprints, create user stories, and prioritize tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | nan                                                                                                                       |
| 19 | Similar to data, use a repository that assigns PIDs to its submissions to capture significant versions of the software (e.g. version producing results described in a research paper).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | nan                                                                                                                       |
| 20 | As general guideline for software development and deployment is to keep the software packages and dependencies updated as much as possible, as working with outdated software can pose risks on the security of the software, especially if developing a front-end or back-end web infrastructure. Moreover, in general updating the dependencies and the overall environment can improve the execution time, and increase the efficiency of the software. | nan                                                                                                                       |
|    | For deployment of a web application, all security measures needs to be employed, from encryption of the end-to-end communications using SSL, to more advance ones such as protection from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                           |
| 22 | Planning is facilitated via regularly held workshops where all developers and contributors are encouraged to attend, brainstorm and come to a consensus on how to proceed with new ideas. There is also an annual workshop that summarizes the status quo of the entire project to give everyone a clear picture of the project in its entirety as well as discuss upcoming plans for each sub group.                                                      | nan                                                                                                                       |
