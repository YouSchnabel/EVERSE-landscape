## Financial support

|    | Is there a lack of financing that you are aware of? What is missing?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|  0 | Definitely missing financing for quality because all it takes to get research published is a working PoC/prototype. Long-term maintenance is not publicly funded.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  1 | I am not aware of anything                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  2 | The maintenance of research software components and infrastructures which were born in many research projects depend on finding a way to sustain the needed financing to pay both the researchers and developers, and the costs of the hardware infrastructure, usually in the form of continuation research projects which are not always 100% aligned with that purpose |
|  3 | There is a lack of continued financial support as a result not always to have access to the needed infrastructure to run software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  8 | continuous support of software maintenance for prototype tools                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  9 | Maintenance!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 10 | Research software and its substantial part in the process of gaining knowledge has only be recently accepted by the funding agencies. So there are some funding possibilities, but usually only focussed on development (and maybe archiving), not so on the maintenance of software. Mostly the funding is available on a national level.                                |
| 11 | Almost no funding for permanent RSE positions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 12 | In my country there are no initiatives to support ensuring software quality that I know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 13 | I am not aware of any.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 15 | I am not aware of financial support targeting specifically software quality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 22 | Software quality and maintenance is not the main focus of the project currently and all maintenance is done by the core development team without dedicated finances for the same as far as I am aware.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 27 | There is some support for scientists, e.g. by the Helmholtz platform HIFIS. But that does not scale down to all development groups. I do not know explicit funding for SW quality in research, except smaller projects.                                                                                                                                                   |

|  0 | German DFG has funding lines for several classes of research software.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | project funding; dedicated funding; mixed funding | Development                                   |
|  3 | It depends. There are projects that have funding and there are other that do not have large-scale funding so there is option of side funding.                                                                                                                                                                                              | mixed funding                                     | Maintenance; Archiving                        |
