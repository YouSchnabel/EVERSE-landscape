|  1 | I am aware of ad-hoc support within time-limited grants, e.g. Eu grant "ATRIUM" provides support for DH researchers to visit one of the partners and receive targeted training for their use case. But it is limited within the project, it is not a long-term solution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Institute or Organization                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                         |

It allows actors (researchers, managers, supervisors etc) to create actionable DMPs that may be freely exchanged among infrastructures for carrying out specific aspects of the Data management process in accordance with the intentions and commitment of Data owners. | Institute or Organization                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 22 | The core development team provides support to anyone willing to contribute to the project in terms of resolving issues that the individual contributor may not be privy to given the size of the whole project. There are regular developer workshops held by the core dev team which contain demos and usage guidelines for new contributors. The core team also lists a number of examples on usage and development of the project that are easy to replicate and follow. | Institute or Organization                                                             | The project does not provide compute resources to contributors. Having state of the art compute resources (eg. dedicated nodes at a HPC) can help accelerate the decelopment process by having a standardized test suite for new algorithms without requiring developers to create local builds of the project which almost always causes user-hardware related dependency issues. |

| 10 | Integrated CI/CD platforms are used on all levels - usually based on the development platforms listed above.                                   | Commercial; Open/free platform; Institute or Organization; Large scale infrastructure | Structural maintenance of software is hard to achieve as it usually needs a transfer of responsibility from the initial (group of) developers to the maintainers - which mostly are not identical. So far, there is no clear route of hand over, especially if the initial developer (group) is not reachable (e.g. left the field). Clear guidelines are missing here. |
