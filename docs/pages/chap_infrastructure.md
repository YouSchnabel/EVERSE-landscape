| 22 | The project does not provide compute resources to contributors. Having state of the art compute resources (eg. dedicated nodes at a HPC) can help accelerate the decelopment process by having a standardized test suite for new algorithms without requiring developers to create local builds of the project which almost always causes user-hardware related dependency issues. | Maintenance is done by the core team using git versioning and standard CI/CD pipelines                                                         |

| 10 | Structural maintenance of software is hard to achieve as it usually needs a transfer of responsibility from the initial (group of) developers to the maintainers - which mostly are not identical. So far, there is no clear route of hand over, especially if the initial developer (group) is not reachable (e.g. left the field). Clear guidelines are missing here. | OSSR is one infrastructure, based on Zenodo: https://zenodo.org/communities/escape2020                                                                                                                         |
